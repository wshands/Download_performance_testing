Get the performance testing scripts
git clone https://github.com/wshands/Download_performance_testing.git

Create an EC2 where the scripts will be run with all the tools that you need installed on it; you will also need these:
Install AWS credentials 
Install AWS CLI
Make changes to the script run_download.pl to make it do what you want; this script will run on each created EC2 instance; put this script on the AMI instance
Create an AMI from the EC2 instance
Put the AMI ID and AMI image ID along with the key pair name and security group ID in the file launch_test_instances.pl

Get Grafana
install Grafana on the machine where you will run the launch_test_instances.pl script (http://docs.grafana.org/installation/debian/) and
launch the Grafana server

On the machine running Grafana server, open port 3000 to the IP address for the machine from which you will run a browser
Launch a browser and enter <ip address of Grafana machine running server>:3000
Login to Grafana as the default user: admin password: admin

Delete the contents of the instances.txt file; these are the EC2 instances that were previously monitored and this file will be updated later
Run the launch_instances.pl srcipt; this will create a Grafana dashboard with the EC2 instances it launches as the things to monitor via AWS Cloudwatch, and put the instance ids in instances.txt
Note the Grafana dashboard number that launch_instances.pl prints at the bottom of the screen each time it launches instances

Select the icon at the top left of the Grafana web page and then select Dashboards
Locate the dashboard name containing the dashboard number output by launch_instances.pl
You should see a generic plot displayed 
Click on graph Title and then select Edit and then select the Metrics tab 
You may see inputs with 'A' Test metric (fake data source) under the graph
Go to the bottom of the screen and next to Panel data source select 'Download Performance'
You should see a performance graph displayed at this point and below that inputs with a Metric, Dimensions, and Period fields filled out
